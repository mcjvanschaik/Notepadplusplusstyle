# Notepad++-style

My Notepad++ custom Markdown Syntax setup. Found bits on the web and added my own preferences. This style uses Source Code Pro when available. 

The default background colour is white. 

## installation

On newer versions of Notepad++ you can import the XML, by opening the Language-menu, choosing the Define your Language... option. Click the import button and find the Markdown.xml file, select it and click Open. Notepad++ will try to import the file and notify you of the result.
